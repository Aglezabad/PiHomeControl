For Central device, we need:
- Raspberry Pi 1 B+ or greater. (This project does not require a lot of resources)
- Adafruit Permaproto Pi HAT! (Optional, you can use normal protoboard)
- 16x2 LCD with I2C controller (Using less pins on Raspberry)
- DHT 11 temperature and humidity sensor (Good results for indoor (0-50ÂºC), but bad for outdoor. I recommend DHT22 for outdoor (greater temperature range).

For wireless thermopods:
- ESP01
- DHT11 (or DHT22)
- 1xAA battery holder (Draft)
- Boost converter to 3.3V
